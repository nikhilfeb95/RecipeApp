# RecipeApp
The same recipe app but with a few changes. Working with MongoDB rather than SQL and using reactive programming and webflux rather than springMVC.
Will also add a few microservices to play around with messaging systems.

What is Reactive Programming?
In computing, reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. With this paradigm it is possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the changed data flow.
